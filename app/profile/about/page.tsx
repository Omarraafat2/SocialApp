          Hi, I'm Omar Raafat, a passionate Front-End Developer based in Cairo, Egypt. 
          I have a Bachelor of Information Systems from the Faculty of Commerce, Helwan University, 
          and have developed a strong foundation in web development, particularly in React and modern 
          JavaScript frameworks. I'm always looking to create engaging, user-friendly interfaces and am 
          constantly refining my skills to stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          I am currently seeking job opportunities where I can contribute to dynamic projects 
          and grow as a developer. If you're looking for someone with a strong work ethic, 
          a drive to learn, and a passion for creating great web experiences, I'd love to connect!
